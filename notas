/* Para la version web: agregale efectos a las "cards"

when user hovers, image should grow, the card should get a border or shadow effect and the cursor should change to pointer

.card-class {
   img {
        transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
   }

   &:hover {
      cursor: pointer;
      -webkit-box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px 5px #000000; 
      box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px 5px #000000;
      img {
           transform: scale(1.05);
      }
   }
}

the key "transition" indicates how an animation will be performed
transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out

all => in which transformation or animation would be executed (in this case all)
0.5s => howlong it will last
ease-in-out => effect to be used

when we set in the hover of the card, that the image should "grow" we are going to scale it a 5% up (scale(1.05))

this animation will take 0.5 to finish,and will grow when enter, shrink when go out

this example of css is created under the assumption you are using sass/scss, if you have to organize things differently then

.card-class img {
   transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

.card-class:hover {
   cursor: pointer;
   -webkit-box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px 5px #000000; 
   box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px 5px #000000;
}

.card-class:hover img {
   transform: scale(1.05);
}

(if you see the sass/scss wraps things inside, instead of having to separate all the components, it is more easy to read and scale) */
